# TRSE-tiktok-cracktros
I made a couple cracktros for 100, 300 and 1000 milestones on TikTok with TRSE for the Commodore 64

I Figured I'd upload them to git since I've had a couple followers ask for source plus since I use the tutorials as launching
points or straight up just use them I should share what they turned into

I am not (as of yet) a SID composer so yes I just slap whatever tune has my ear at the time into these as I accept my place
as a total amatuer to developing on this platform.
